            <h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">By becoming a member or using our Services, you accept and agree to these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). Therefore, it is important that you carefully read through these Terms. If you do not consent to these Terms, you should not register
                with Trimio.
            </p>

            <h4>Trimio Services</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Trimio is a platform that connects the best barbers (collectively or individually, "Professionals") providing hair and grooming services ("Grooming Services") with clients seeking such services ("Clients" or "you"). The Professionals and Clients
                are both users of the Services provided by Trimio and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users."</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Trimio solely provides a platform for Professionals and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Grooming Services. Trimio does not provide or contract for Grooming Services, and Professionals and Clients
                contract independently for the provision of Grooming Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Professional, the Grooming Services to be provided and the location at which Grooming Services will be performed, whether
                on the premises of a Professional or at a site designated by the Client. Any decision by a Client to receive Grooming Services or by a Professional to provide Grooming Services is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at
                their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and
                Professionals.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Grooming does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Grooming Services provided by Professionals nor of the integrity, responsibility
                or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Professionals or Clients. Trimio makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Grooming Services offered or provided by Professionals or requested by Clients through
                use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Professional. You understand that Trimio does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background
                of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. Trimio does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with
                respect to Grooming Services on the Services. Trimio does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Trimio may, but
                is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Professionals via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background
                check, and may terminate a Professional based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not Trimio conducts a background check or first party interview on a Professional, each Client
                must decide whether a Professional is suited to such Client's needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know. NEITHER COMPANY
                NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS
                AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Although the Services are intended to provide a Professional's availability in real-time, it is possible that a scheduling conflict may occur that requires the Professional to reschedule your reservation. Creation of a reservation using the
                Services is not a guarantee that the Professional will honor the reservation as scheduled.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Trimio cannot guarantee availability of the Services to any User.</p>

            <h4>Your Account</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">You can at any time choose to cancel/end your account at your convenience. Please note that uninstalling the mobile application or closing your account will not automatically stop your subscription — you must actively cancel the subscription.
                Please note that if you have subscribed to Trimio through the use of App Store, you can only cancel your subscription through the use of their services. To find out how to cancel the subscription and/or your account, please follow the
                instructions in the app or on the website. Special terms and conditions apply to Trimio Premium.</p>

            <h4>Trimio Premium</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">This section only applies when you purchase and/or subscribe to Trimio Premium or other paid products. By paying the subscription fee, you get access to Trimio Premium during the time your subscription is valid, subject to these Terms.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">All subscriptions with Trimio Premium are paid in advance.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">You may at any time terminate your membership, in which case your membership will still be valid for the subscription time you have already paid for. If you have subscribed to Trimio through the use of App Store or any other such service provider,
                using in-app purchase, you can only cancel your subscription through the use of their services. Subscription fees can be found in the mobile application. Special terms and conditions may apply. Trimio reserves the right to change the subscription
                fees from time to time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">You hereby consent to start using the Services immediately upon subscribing with Trimio Premium or other paid products. This means that you will only have 14 days to withdraw from the contract with Trimio from the date you receive confirmation
                of your subscription via email if you do not start using the Services during that period. To use your right of withdrawal, you must send an email to Trimio (you will find our contact details at the bottom of this document). Any prepaid
                fees will be refunded within 30 days. All payments handled by Apple, such as in-app purchases, can only be refunded by Apple and with Apple’s consent. If you would like to contact Apple, please <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4098"
                    target="blank_">click here</a>. Default in payment shall not be deemed as a termination of a Trimio Premium subscription.</p>

            <h4>Trials</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Trimio occasionally offers in particular to new users free Subscription Access for testing purposes for a certain period of time (“Trial”). Trimio determines, at its sole discretion, if you may participate in a Trial. In case of an important
                reason, Trimio may discontinue or change such free Trial at any time without prior notice or notification.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">You can only participate in certain Trials if you enter your payment details when you sign up for the Trial. In such a case, we need your consent at the beginning of the Trial that your free access will be converted into a paid Subscription
                Access on the day following the end of the Trial. In this situation, your subscription renews itself on a recurring basis and can be terminated up to one day before the end of the respective subscription period.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If you do not wish to have the Subscription Access and the charge associated with it, you must cancel your Subscription Access given to you during the Trial before the end of the Trial (for example, by simply going to your Trimio Account Settings
                or the respective app store settings).</p>
